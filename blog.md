### Day 0: Setting up

`3/11/22 - 3/12/22`

The 11th and 12th have been my days to set up the learning path and find out what I want to focus on. I plan to start tomorrow (Sunday) so I can have nice weekly sections. Over the coming weeks I will change the checklist as I learn more, but the general idea will stay the same.
