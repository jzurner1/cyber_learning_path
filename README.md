# Introduction
My name is [Joseph Zurner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-zurner/) and I am a cybersecurity student at Harford Community College. I am planning on switching to a four-year university in the fall of 2022, but until then, I will be creating some groundwork to familiarize myself with the field. As of writing this introduction I have some knowledge of cybersecurity, mainly from websites such as TryHackMe and a couple classes I have taken, but my goal is to get ahead and earn some certifications before graduation. The goal of this checklist is to organize my learning path, so I know where I stand as well as giving readers a way to follow along. In addition, publicly committing to this is a good way to maintain progress. My goal is to learn three or more concepts each week but this may change as I am currently taking 19 credits and don't have too much free time.


# Section 1: The Basics
Before taking on any certifications, I want to get a strong background on some universal topics. These include the basics of networking, penetration testing, tools, and operating systems (namely Windows and Linux). I am familiar with most of these topics, but I want to get a deeper understanding of them.

## 1.2: Networks
I *think* I gathered all the major components and put them in a logical order:
- [ ] IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- [ ] MAC addresses
- [ ] DHCP
- [ ] ARP
- [ ] LANs and topologies
- [ ] Packets
- [ ] SMB
- [ ] OSI model
- [ ] Encapsulation and de-encapsulation
- [ ] Data vs segments/datagrams vs packets vs frames vs bits
- [ ] TCP
- [ ] UDP
- [ ] Hardware (router, switch, etc)
- [ ] Requests and responses
- [ ] Firewalls
- [ ] The internet
- [ ] Web servers and websites
- [ ] Cookies
- [ ] URLs and DNS
- [ ] HTTP and HTTPS
- [ ] Proxy
- [ ] VPNs
- [ ] Port forwarding

# Section 2: The eJPT Certification
The eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) is a certification test graded on performance in penetration tests based on real-world scenarios. It is a more practical alternative to tests such as the CEH or Security+, and I chose this as a starting point because of its hands-on format.
