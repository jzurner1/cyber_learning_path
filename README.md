# My Cybersecurity Learning Path
## Introduction
My name is Joseph Zurner and I am a cybersecurity student at Harford Community College. I am planning on switching to a four-year university in the fall of 2022, but until then, I will be creating some groundwork to familiarize myself with the field. As of writing this introduction I have some knowledge of cybersecurity, mainly from websites such as TryHackMe and a couple classes I have taken, but my goal is to get ahead and earn some certifications before graduation. The goal of this checklist is to organize my learning path, so I know where I stand as well as giving readers a way to follow along. In addition, publicly committing to this is a good way to maintain progress. My goal is to learn three or more concepts each week but this may change as I am currently taking 19 credits and don't have too much free time.


## Section 1: The Basics and the eJPT Certification
The eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) is a certification test graded on performance in penetration tests based on real-world scenarios. It is a more practical alternative to tests such as the CEH or Security+, and I chose this as a starting point because of its hands-on format. For more information, visit the [official website](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/).

This checklist will be based off a few sources (excluding the INE learning path, I can't afford $50/month), namely [this Medium article by InfoSec Write-Ups](https://infosecwriteups.com/ultimate-guide-to-pass-ejpt-in-the-first-attempt-by-mayur-parmar-75effc877394), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities), and a couple others.
