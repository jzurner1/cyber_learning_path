# My Cybersecurity Learning Path
## Introduction
My name is Joseph Zurner and I am a cybersecurity student at Harford Community College. I am planning on switching to a four-year university in the fall of 2022, but until then, I will be creating some groundwork to familiarize myself with the field. As of writing this introduction I have some knowledge of cybersecurity, mainly from websites such as TryHackMe and a couple classes I have taken, but my goal is to get ahead and earn some certifications before graduation. The goal of this checklist is to organize my learning path so I know where I stand as well as giving readers a way to follow along. In addition, publically committing to this is a good way to maintain progress.
